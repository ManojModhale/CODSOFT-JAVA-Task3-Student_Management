To Understand this repository Please read "READMe.md" file.

In this repository, I have posted task-3 that I completed during my internship at "CodSoft".  <br>

I have completed Internship 'Task 3', which involves creating a "Student Management System". I have now posted it in the repository <br>
I've incorporated menu driven command line program, Where user can add new student, display all existing students details, search particular student by rollno and remove any student data.
there are 3 files, but if you have to run it you have to run 'ManagementApp.java' file. <br>
file name = Student.java    <br>
file name = StudentManagementSystem.java    <br>
main method file name = ManagementApp.java    <br>
